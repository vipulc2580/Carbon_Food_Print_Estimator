DISH_METRICS_SYSTEM_PROMPT="""
You are a sustainability and food carbon analyst AI.

Your role: given a dish name, estimate its environmental impact.
You use life-cycle assessment (LCA) intuition, typical recipes,
and global average emission factors for ingredients. Be approximate
but consistent, and always focus on *per serving* estimates.
"""

DISH_METRICS_USER_PROMPT="""
Task: Estimate the environmental impact of the following dish:

Dish: {dish_name}

### Steps you must follow:
1. Infer a typical recipe for the dish (assume standard regional preparation).
2. Estimate the serving size in grams (main dishes are typically 350–500 g).
3. Estimate total CO2e emissions (kg) per serving, based on global average emission factors.
4. Derive an impact rating (A–E) from the total CO2e using the provided rules.
5. Convert CO2e into car miles driven (1 kg CO2e ≈ 2.4 miles).
6. Approximate the ingredient count.

Output Rules:
-**Response Output JSON Format**:

{{
  "dish": string,
  "estimated_carbon_kg": float,
  "serving_size_g": float,
  "estimation_accuracy": float,
  "impact_rating": string,
  "carbon_per_serving_kg": float,
  "ingredient_count": int,
  "car_miles_equivalent": float
}}

- estimation_accuracy is your confidence in percentage (0–100).
- impact_rating scale:
    A = < 0.5 kg CO2e
    B = 0.5–1.5
    C = 1.5–2.5
    D = 2.5–4.0
    E = >4.0
- Do not include any explanation outside the JSON.
- **If {dish_name} is not a valid dish name or cannot be recognized**,
  return an empty JSON: {{}}
"""

DISH_INGREDIENTS_SYSTEM_PROMPT="""
You are a culinary sustainability assistant. 
Your task is to break down a dish into a structured list of its key ingredients, with approximate weights in kilograms. 
Weights should be reasonable for a single dish (not for bulk cooking). 
"""

DISH_INGREDIENTS_USER_PROMPT="""
You are tasked with extracting a typical ingredient list for the given dish.

Dish:{dish_name}

### Instructions:
1. Infer a standard regional recipe for the dish.
2. Break it down into its main ingredients.
3. Estimate approximate ingredient weights in kilograms for one serving.

Output Format:
**Return only a JSON array of objects, each with the following keys:**

[
  {{
    "ingredient_name": string,
    "ingredient_weight_kg": float
  }}
]

Rules:
- Use lowercase names for ingredient_name.
- Use decimal values for ingredient_weight_kg (kg).
- Make sure all ingredients are list like spices,salt,water,oil,chillies, etc this just couple of examples.
- Ensure weights roughly add up to a realistic serving size.
- **If {dish_name} is not a valid dish name or cannot be recognized, return an empty JSON array: []**
- Do not include any explanation outside the JSON.

DISH_LCA_DATA_SYSTEM_PROMPT="""
You are a sustainability and food impact analysis assistant. 
Your role is to estimate the carbon footprint (kg CO2e) for each food ingredient using global 
life cycle assessment (LCA) research such as Poore & Nemecek (2018) and Foodsteps datasets. 
"""

DISH_LCA_DATA_USER_PROMPT="""
  Given List of Ingredient for a particular Dish
  ### You can scrape data from internet 
  
  **You must**:
  - Map the user-provided ingredient to a known ingredient in standard LCA datasets.
  - Provide approximate average carbon footprint (kg CO2e per kg of ingredient).
  - Multiply by the weight (if given) to estimate per-ingredient contribution.
  - Return structured JSON with the following fields for each ingredient:
    - ingredient_name (from user input)
    - matched_ingredient (the canonical LCA food item you mapped it to)
    - carbon_footprint_kg_co2e (float, per given weight if weight is specified, else per kg)
    - farming_footprint_kg_co2e (float, emissions from farming & cultivation)
    - packaging_footprint_kg_co2e (float, emissions from packaging)
    - processing_footprint_kg_co2e (float, emissions from industrial processing)
    - retail_footprint_kg_co2e (float, emissions from retail storage & display)
    - transportation_footprint_kg_co2e (float, emissions from logistics & transport)
    - match_confidence (float between 0 and 1)
    - matched (true/false)
    - lca_source (string: e.g., "poore_nemecek" or "foodsteps")
